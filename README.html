Click "Clone or Download" button and then "Download ZIP" to download this repository on your PC. 
Then you can easily see the items on a folder rather than having to click the files one by one to see the picture.

Remember that this repository does not hold all items(swords*) and their images. 
I have only included the weapons(swords*) that I liked or that felt unique to me in some way. 
There are many weapons(swords*) that I didn't collect here (The reason is them being too old/bad and not good for fashion IMO) 
Therefore do not mistake this for an encyclopedia.

-Scythes, Staves/Wands, Helms, Pets and Cape/Cloaks are completely complete except for some Rare capes I couldn't find any photo of 
(And World Cup capes) or some clickable forms of the items. (According to DF Encyclopedia's A-Z Accessories and A-Z Weapons page)

-"Other" is simply DA/non-DA classic items. 

-If an item of same looks has both a DC and non-DC version, I will be putting it under "Other" because it can be achieved without DCs. 
Same goes for rare and non-rare. Achievability is what comes first here.

-Special Offer items go under "DC" if they are not rare.

-If an item is both rare and DC, it goes under "Rare", both DC and Seasonal, goes under "DC". 
The priority is basically Rare -> DC -> Seasonal.

-Some of the item names are not their exact names in the game but a part of it, so search accordingly. 
For Example, if there are two weapons named "Blue Latid Axe" and "Dark Blue Latid Axe" both looking the same I might call it "Latid Axe".

All the info is gathered from DF Forum Encyclopedia's "Pets / Guests", "A-Z Weapons" and "A-Z Accessories" pages 
and if there are some items not listed there I possibly might have missed them too. 
(Some examples being Survivalist Cape, Frozen Staff and Noon Promise Staff although I could find them, 
they were not listed on A-Z Accessories page)

!!!!! If you find some items I have missed contact me on Discord throwing a pic of them at me. 
Or notice me if any of the categorizations are wrong or you have found an item that was not listed on A-Z pages. Or if I made typos. 
Thanks...
