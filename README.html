Remember that this repository does not hold all items and their images. I have only included the items that I liked or felt unique to me in some way. There are many items that I didn't collect here (The reason is them being too old/bad and not good for fashion IMO), therefore do not mistake this for an encyclopedia.

-Other is simply DA/non-DA classic items. 
-If an item of same look has both a DC and non-DC version, I will be putting it under "Other" because it can be achieved without need of DCs.
-Special Offer items go under "DC" if they are not rare.
-If an item is both rare and DC, it goes under "Rare", both DC and Seasonal, goes under "DC". The priority is basically Rare -> DC -> Seasonal -> Other.
-Some of the item names are not their exact names in the game but a part of it, so search accordingly. For instance, if there are two weapons named "Blue Latid Axe" and "Strong Blue Latid Axe" both looking the same I might just call it "Latid Axe".
